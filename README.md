# automata

* arbitrary machines running on arbitrary topologies.

* so spaces can be continuous or discrete, have arbitrary number of dimensions, be graph structures, hexagonal grids, etc
* machines can be stohastic or deterministic, implemented as RAM-machines, generative grammars, blind or with perception, etc 
 
should be able to simulate transformation rule based generation like L-systems, brownian motion etc..
or stuff that perceves, like CA, boids, etc.


spaces are immutable objects, machines are functions returning other machines potentially with their location transformed
views, storage and controllers as plugins
